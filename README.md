# Exoplanetary
Exoplanet Star Map

Utilizes NASA's open exoplanet API to retrieve data on confirmed exoplanets in the observable universe. Renders the planets to the appropriate position in the night sky (app screen) based on declination and right ascension coordinates. 
Planets are clickable and give details regarding the planet. An elliptical orbit map also shows the speed of a planet's orbit relative to its parent start.
